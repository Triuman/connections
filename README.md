There is a connection diagram as a goal.
And we give players some dot and ask them to connect them, so they look like the other diagram.

Mechanics;
- Put one finger on a point and drag it to another point and release. This will create a connection between two points.


Challenges for next levels;
- Moving diagram. So, player cannot map it easily.
- We can use a 3D cube's surface for advance mode.
