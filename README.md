There is a connection graph as a goal which we will call 'the goal graph'.
And we give players some dot and ask them to connect them, so they look like the other graph.


Mechanics;
- Put one finger on a point and drag it to another point and release. This will create a connection between two points.
- Click twice on a point to remove it.
- Every level, player has a limited time that they can use to see the goal graph.


Challenges for next levels;
- Moving goal graph nodes. So, player cannot map it easily.
- We can use a 3D cube's surface for advance mode.
